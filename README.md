# Alokcoder-Loan-Status-Prediction---Analytics-Vidya-Dataset
Building a Model to predict if a loan would be sanctioned or not. 

Approach
1. Missing Data replacement.
2. Using knn to predict missing data.
3. Using Label Encoder and OneHotEncoding.
4. Using Logistic Regession to Make prediction.
5. Using GridSearchCV to find the best Hyperparameters.
6. Using the Built model to predict results fro the test Dataset.
7. Exporting the result to .csv file for uploading.
